## 🎯 Your Implementation Path

### Week 1: Foundation
**Goal**: Get core HITL infrastructure running

Day 1-3 Focus:
```markdown
Prompt for Claude Code:
"Using orchestrator.py as the foundation, implement the Marimo migration 
from HITL_DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md Phase 1.2. Convert app_working.py to 
marimo_app.py with reactive cells. Include side-by-side comparison tests."
```

### Week 2: Intelligence
**Goal**: Add sophisticated automation and AI agents

Day 4-6 Focus:
```markdown
Prompt for Claude Code:
"Implement Phase 2 from HITL_DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md - Dynamic Risk-Based 
Escalation and Parallel Feedback. Extend orchestrator.py with confidence 
scoring and multi-reviewer support. Add real-time WebSocket updates."
```

### Week 3: Production
**Goal**: Complete testing, optimization, and deployment

Day 7-12 Focus:
```markdown
Prompt for Claude Code:
"Following Phase 4 from HITL_DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md, create comprehensive 
test coverage >90%, visual regression suite, and production deployment 
configuration. Include monitoring and alerting."
```

## 📊 Key Features You'll Build

### 1. **Intelligent Routing**
- Automatic escalation based on confidence scores
- Risk assessment for sensitive data
- Priority queuing for urgent tasks
- Load balancing across reviewers

### 2. **Parallel Processing**
- Non-blocking human feedback
- Async approval workflows
- Batch processing capabilities
- Real-time collaboration

### 3. **Continuous Learning**
- RLHF from human corrections
- Automatic model improvements
- A/B testing framework
- Performance tracking

### 4. **Visual Testing**
- Screenshot-based regression testing
- Automatic baseline updates
- Diff visualization
- CI/CD integration

## 🔧 Development Workflow

### For Each Feature:

1. **Review Context**
   ```bash
   cat CLAUDE.md  # Understand project structure
   cat PROMPT_ENGINEERING_GUIDE.md  # Get prompt template
   ```

2. **Implement with Claude Code**
   ```markdown
   Use template from PROMPT_ENGINEERING_GUIDE.md
   Include tests and screenshots
   Reference existing patterns
   ```

3. **Validate**
   ```bash
   python test_orchestrator.py  # Run tests
   ls screenshots/orchestrator/current/  # Check visuals
   curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/metrics  # Check metrics
   ```

4. **Document**
   - Update CLAUDE.md with learnings
   - Add examples to codebase
   - Update test baselines if needed

## 📈 Success Metrics

Track these to ensure you're on the right path:

| Metric | Current | Target | How to Measure |
|--------|---------|--------|----------------|
| Test Coverage | ~45% | >90% | `pytest --cov` |
| Visual Regression | N/A | <5% | Playwright tests |
| Response Time | 3-5s | <2s | Performance tests |
| Human Review Time | 100% | <50% | Time tracking |
| Automation Rate | 0% | 90% | Workflow metrics |

## 🚨 Common Pitfalls & Solutions

### Pitfall 1: Trying to Do Everything at Once
**Solution**: Follow the phased approach in HITL_DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md

### Pitfall 2: Not Testing Incrementally
**Solution**: Run tests after every change using test_orchestrator.py

### Pitfall 3: Ignoring Visual Regression
**Solution**: Capture screenshots for every UI change

### Pitfall 4: Poor Prompt Engineering
**Solution**: Use templates from PROMPT_ENGINEERING_GUIDE.md

## 💡 Pro Tips

### 1. **Start with the Orchestrator**
The `orchestrator.py` is your foundation. Understand it fully before proceeding.

### 2. **Use Parallel Development**
```bash
# Terminal 1: Run orchestrator
python orchestrator.py --debug

# Terminal 2: Run tests continuously
watch python test_orchestrator.py

# Terminal 3: Monitor logs
tail -f logs/*.log
```

### 3. **Leverage Claude Code Effectively**
- Provide complete context in first prompt
- Use iterative refinement
- Always request tests with implementation
- Ask for screenshots/validation

### 4. **Maintain Momentum**
- Commit working code frequently
- Update documentation immediately
- Test continuously
- Review screenshots regularly
