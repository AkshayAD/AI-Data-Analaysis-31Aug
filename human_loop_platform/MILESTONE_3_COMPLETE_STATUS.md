## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Key Components Added:
1. **Gemini API Integration**
   - Full `google.generativeai` implementation
   - Multiple model support
   - Error handling and fallbacks

2. **Data Pipeline**
   - Pandas for data processing
   - Session state for persistence
   - File parsing for multiple formats

3. **AI Features**
   - Context-aware prompting
   - Structured response parsing
   - Conversation management

## 📝 How to Use

### Step 1: Configure API (Stage 0)
```python
1. Enter your Gemini API key
2. Select model (default: gemini-2.5-flash)
3. Click "Test Connection"
4. Should see "✅ Successfully connected"
```

### Step 2: Upload Data
```python
1. Go to "Data Upload" tab
2. Upload CSV/Excel/JSON files
3. Files are actually processed
4. Data preview shows real content
```

### Step 3: Generate Plan (Stage 1)
```python
1. Click "Generate Analysis Plan"
2. Real AI generates structured plan
3. Edit in YAML/JSON if needed
4. Chat with AI for clarifications
```

### Step 4: Analyze Data (Stage 2)
```python
1. View real data profiles
2. Check actual quality metrics
3. Generate visualizations from your data
4. Get AI insights on patterns
```

## 🚨 Important Notes

### What's Still Pending:
- Stages 3-6 (Task Configuration, Execution, Review)
- Advanced ML model training
- Real-time collaboration features
- Cloud deployment setup

### Requirements:
- **Gemini API Key Required**: Get from https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey
- **Python Packages**: All in requirements.txt
- **Data Formats**: CSV, Excel, JSON, TXT, PDF supported

### Cost Considerations:
- Each API call to Gemini costs tokens
- 2.5 Flash is most cost-effective
- 2.5 Pro for complex analysis
