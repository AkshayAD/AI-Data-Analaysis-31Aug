# AI Data Analysis Team with Marimo Integration

## Overview

This branch successfully integrates the conversation flow from the AI-Data-Analysis-Team repository with Marimo notebook execution capabilities. The system simulates a collaborative AI team that guides users through structured data analysis with automated task execution.

## Key Features

### 1. AI Team Personas
- **Manager**: Creates strategic analysis plans and final reports
- **Analyst**: Performs data profiling and executes technical tasks
- **Associate**: Generates specific analysis tasks and provides guidance

### 2. Conversation Flow (from AI-Data-Analysis-Team)
The application follows this exact flow:
1. **Project Setup**: User provides project details and uploads data
2. **Manager Planning**: AI Manager creates strategic analysis plan
3. **Data Understanding**: AI Analyst examines and profiles the data
4. **Task Generation**: AI Associate generates specific, executable tasks
5. **Marimo Execution**: Tasks are converted to Marimo notebooks and executed
6. **Final Report**: Manager synthesizes results into executive report

### 3. Marimo Integration
- Automatic conversion of analysis tasks to Marimo notebooks
- Dynamic code generation based on task requirements
- Notebook execution and result capture
- Interactive notebook viewing and editing

```

## How It Works

### Step 1: Project Initialization
```python
# User provides:
- Project name
- Problem statement
- Data context
- CSV/Excel files
```

### Step 2: AI Manager Planning
```python
# Manager creates strategic plan including:
- Executive summary
- Data assessment strategy
- Analysis methodology
- Expected deliverables
- Risk factors
- Success metrics
```

### Step 3: Data Understanding
```python
# Analyst examines data:
- Data quality assessment
- Key statistics
- Data relationships
- Potential approaches
- Technical recommendations
```

### Step 4: Task Generation
```python
# Associate generates 5-8 specific tasks:
TASK 1: Exploratory data analysis
TASK 2: Trend identification
TASK 3: Customer segmentation
TASK 4: Revenue forecasting
TASK 5: Anomaly detection
```

### Step 5: Marimo Execution
```python
# For each task:
1. Analyst generates Python code
2. Code is wrapped in Marimo notebook
3. Notebook is executed
4. Results are captured
```

### Step 6: Final Report
```python
# Manager creates executive report:
- Key findings
- Data-driven recommendations
- Implementation roadmap
- Expected impact
```

## Sample Marimo Notebook

```python
import marimo as mo
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Task: Perform sales trend analysis
# Generated: 2025-09-01

mo.md("## Sales Trend Analysis")

# Load data
df = pd.read_csv('sales_data.csv')

# Analysis code
monthly_sales = df.groupby('month')['revenue'].sum()
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
plt.plot(monthly_sales.index, monthly_sales.values)
plt.title('Monthly Sales Trends')
plt.show()

mo.md("### Key Insights")
mo.md(f"- Peak revenue: ${monthly_sales.max():,.2f}")
mo.md(f"- Average monthly: ${monthly_sales.mean():,.2f}")
```

## Usage

### Running the Application

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install streamlit pandas marimo google-generativeai

# Set API key
export GEMINI_API_KEY="your-api-key"

# Run application
streamlit run streamlit_app_marimo_integrated.py
```

### Testing

```bash
# Run test suite
python3 test_marimo_integration.py
```

Test Results:
- ✅ AI Personas module
- ✅ Workflow simulation
- ✅ Task generation
- ✅ Notebook creation
- ⚠️ Marimo execution (requires marimo installation)

## Key Improvements from Original

1. **Automated Execution**: Tasks are automatically converted to executable Marimo notebooks
2. **Code Generation**: AI generates actual Python code for each analysis task
3. **Interactive Notebooks**: Users can view and edit generated notebooks
4. **Result Integration**: Execution results are captured and integrated into final report
5. **Modular Architecture**: Clean separation between personas, execution, and reporting

## API Configuration

The system uses Google's Gemini API for AI capabilities:

```python
# In sidebar
st.text_input("Gemini API Key", type="password")

# Models supported
- gemini-2.0-flash-exp (default)
- gemini-1.5-pro
- gemini-1.5-flash
```

## Conversation History

All interactions are tracked:
```python
{
    "persona": "manager",
    "content": "Analysis plan...",
    "timestamp": "2025-09-01T12:00:00"
}
```

## Benefits

1. **Structured Approach**: Follows proven analysis methodology
2. **AI Guidance**: Expert personas guide each step
3. **Automated Execution**: Tasks run automatically in Marimo
4. **Comprehensive Reports**: Executive-ready outputs
5. **Full Traceability**: Complete conversation and execution history

## Next Steps

1. Add more sophisticated code generation templates
2. Implement parallel task execution
3. Add visualization gallery
4. Support for SQL databases
5. Real-time collaboration features

## Conclusion

This integration successfully combines the conversational AI team approach from AI-Data-Analysis-Team with Marimo's notebook execution capabilities, creating a powerful automated data analysis platform that guides users from problem statement to actionable insights.
